## Exposition

Discovery Covid is a personal project of mine that I've started during the pandemic. I wanted to create a website where people are able to access updated information surrounding COVID-19 in an intuitive and visual way. I decided to make a web application that visualizes COVID-19 data from third parties and consolidated them into a MySQL database. This data is then pulled by the front-end and graphed on a map powered by Leaflet as a proportional symbol map.

## Current State

I have taken down the website as we are at the declining phase of COVID-19 and the conditions are stabilizing, at least that's the case for Canada. I wanted to host the website because I think it still holds useful information but I will do so after I do some refactoring to the backend and after setuping up my new VPS.
